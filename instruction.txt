DocFinder Home Page Development Guide
Welcome to the DocFinder frontend repository! This guide focuses specifically on building the content sections for the app/page.jsx of our Next.js application. Your existing layout.jsx (with its Header and Footer) will wrap these components.
DocFinder aims to revolutionize healthcare access in Bangladesh, connecting patients with the right doctors quickly and efficiently.
🚀 Project Overview
This project is the Next.js frontend for DocFinder, a marketplace for booking doctor appointments. The goal is to recreate the core sections of the DocPlanner landing page (excluding the header and footer) as modular, reusable components, specifically organized within a components/home directory, to be placed within the app/page.jsx.

⚡ Core Sections & Component Breakdown (for app/page.jsx)
Each of these components should be developed individually and then imported sequentially into your app/page.jsx from the components/home directory.

Main Headline: Large, bold, text-cyan-600.
Sub-headline: text-[#667070].
Layout: Centered text, ample vertical spacing.

Action: A Button component with text like "Choose a doctor".
