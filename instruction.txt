DocFinder Department Pages Development Guide
Welcome to the DocFinder frontend repository! This guide details the development of dynamic Department Pages (e.g., src/app/department/[slug]/page.jsx) in our Next.js application. Your existing src/app/layout.jsx (with its Header and Footer) will wrap these components.
Key Feature: The Departments link in your Header will present a submenu. Clicking any department (e.g., "Marketing & PR", "IT, Product, Data") will load a page with a consistent structure, but content tailored to that specific department.
DocFinder Department Pages aim to provide detailed insights into specific teams, their roles, culture, and open positions, attracting specialized talent by showcasing each department's unique identity.
🚀 Project Overview
This project involves creating a dynamic routing structure for department pages. The goal is to build a reusable component set (src/components/department) that can render content for any department based on the URL slug. The src/app/department/[slug]/page.jsx will serve as the single template for all department pages, pulling in relevant data for each.
Brand Colors:
Primary Accent: #06B6D4 (equivalent to text-cyan-600 in Tailwind CSS)
Main Text: #667070
🛠️ Tech Stack
Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
Styling: Tailwind CSS 3.x
Language: JavaScript (JSX)
📁 Project Structure
All new components specifically for department pages will reside under src/components/department/. The single dynamic page will be at src/app/department/[slug]/page.jsx.

⚡ Core Components & Page Breakdown
A. The Header's DepartmentsDropdown.jsx (New or Updated)
Component: src/components/header/DepartmentsDropdown.jsx (or similar)
Description: This component will render the interactive dropdown menu that appears when a user hovers over/clicks the "Departments" link in your main Header.
Content:
A list of clickable links, each representing a department.
Example Links (from mock data):
"Marketing & PR" -> /department/marketing-pr
"Customer Success & Sales" -> /department/customer-success-sales
"IT, Product, Data" -> /department/it-product-data
"Finance & Administration" -> /department/finance-administration
"HR & more" -> /department/hr-more
Styling Notes:
Use Tailwind CSS for dropdown styling (e.g., absolute, bg-white, shadow-lg, rounded-md).
Hover states for individual links.
B. The Dynamic Department Page (src/app/department/[slug]/page.jsx)
Page Path: src/app/department/[slug]/page.jsx
URL Structure Example:
/department/marketing-pr
/department/it-product-data
Description: This is the single page template that will render content for any given department. It will receive the slug (e.g., marketing-pr) from the URL parameters. Based on this slug, it will fetch (from src/data/departments.js for now) the specific content for that department and pass it down as props to the reusable components.
Component Integration: This page will import and use the following reusable components from src/components/department/, passing dynamic props to each:
1. Hero Department Section
Component: src/components/department/HeroDepartmentSection.jsx
Props: departmentData (containing name, intro paragraphs, CTA link, background image path)
Content:
Headline: departmentData.name
Paragraphs: departmentData.introParagraphs
Call-to-Action Button: "See All Openings" (links to /department/[slug]#openings).
Background Visual: departmentData.heroBackground image.
2. Roles & Culture Section
Component: src/components/department/RolesAndCultureSection.jsx
Props: departmentData.rolesAndCulture (an array of role objects, each with title, description, icon)
Content:
Headline: "Our {departmentData.name} Roles & Responsibilities".
Grid of Role Cards: Dynamically map departmentData.rolesAndCulture to display each role.
3. Team Photos Gallery
Component: src/components/department/TeamPhotosGallery.jsx
Props: departmentData.teamGallery (containing main team photo, quotes, office interior photo)
Content:
Headline: "People at DocFinder {departmentData.name}".
Main Team Photo: departmentData.teamGallery.mainPhoto.
Quotes: departmentData.teamGallery.quotes.
Office Interior Photo: departmentData.teamGallery.officePhoto.
4. Testimonial Section
Component: src/components/department/TestimonialSection.jsx
Props: departmentData.testimonial (optional: a specific testimonial for this department, or a generic CTA)
Content:
Headline: "See more job offers in other departments" (A general CTA, or department-specific if testimonial prop has it).
Background: Generic or departmentData.testimonialBackground.
5. Department Positions Section (Job Listings for this Department)
Component: src/components/department/DepartmentPositionsSection.jsx
Props: departmentData.openPositions (an array of job listing objects)
Content:
Headline: "Explore Open {departmentData.name} Positions at DocFinder".
Job Listings: Dynamically map departmentData.openPositions to display available roles.
C. Mock Data Structure (src/data/departments.js)
You'll need a JavaScript file to hold all your department-specific content.
code
JavaScript
// src/data/departments.js

export const departments = [
  {
    slug: 'marketing-pr',
    name: 'Marketing & PR',
    heroBackground: '/images/department-hero-bg-marketing.jpg',
    introParagraphs: [
      "At DocFinder, our Marketing & PR team crafts compelling stories...",
      "If you're passionate about making a real impact..."
    ],
    rolesAndCulture: [
      { title: "Brand Storytelling", description: "Crafting narratives...", icon: "/images/icon-megaphone.svg" },
      // ... other roles for Marketing & PR
    ],
    teamGallery: {
      mainPhoto: '/images/marketing-team.jpg',
      quotes: [{ text: "The atmosphere is incredibly dynamic...", attribution: "Naznin, PR Specialist" }],
      officePhoto: '/images/marketing-office.jpg'
    },
    openPositions: [
      { id: 1, title: "CRO Specialist", location: "Dhaka, Bangladesh" },
      // ... other job listings for Marketing & PR
    ]
  },
  {
    slug: 'it-product-data',
    name: 'IT, Product, Data',
    heroBackground: '/images/department-hero-bg-it.jpg',
    introParagraphs: [
      "Our IT, Product, and Data team are the architects of DocFinder's platform...",
      "Join us to build cutting-edge solutions..."
    ],
    rolesAndCulture: [
      { title: "Software Development", description: "Building robust backend APIs...", icon: "/images/icon-code.svg" },
      // ... other roles for IT, Product, Data
    ],
    teamGallery: {
      mainPhoto: '/images/it-team.jpg',
      quotes: [{ text: "I love solving complex problems...", attribution: "Rahim, Senior Engineer" }],
      officePhoto: '/images/it-office.jpg'
    },
    openPositions: [
      { id: 10, title: "Backend Engineer", location: "Dhaka, Bangladesh" },
      // ... other job listings for IT, Product, Data
    ]
  },
  // ... other departments
];

export const getDepartmentBySlug = (slug) => {
  return departments.find(dep => dep.slug === slug);
};
🚀 Getting Started
Ensure your Next.js project is running:
code
Bash
npm run dev
# or yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
Create the src/data/departments.js file and populate it with mock data for your departments.
Create the src/components/header/DepartmentsDropdown.jsx component.
This component should fetch the list of departments (e.g., departments.map(dep => ({ name: dep.name, slug: dep.slug }))) from your mock data and render the submenu links.
Integrate this into your main src/app/layout.jsx (or wherever your Header component resides).
Create component files:
For each section listed under "B. The Dynamic Department Page," create its corresponding .jsx file inside src/components/department/. These components should be designed to accept props.
Create the dynamic page route:
Create the file src/app/department/[slug]/page.jsx.
Implement src/app/department/[slug]/page.jsx:
code
Jsx
// src/app/department/[slug]/page.jsx
import HeroDepartmentSection from '@/components/department/HeroDepartmentSection';
import RolesAndCultureSection from '@/components/department/RolesAndCultureSection';
import TeamPhotosGallery from '@/components/department/TeamPhotosGallery';
import TestimonialSection from '@/components/department/TestimonialSection';
import DepartmentPositionsSection from '@/components/department/DepartmentPositionsSection';
import { getDepartmentBySlug } from '@/data/departments'; // Import your mock data helper

export default function DepartmentPage({ params }) {
  const { slug } = params;
  const departmentData = getDepartmentBySlug(slug);

  if (!departmentData) {
    // Handle case where department is not found (e.g., show 404 or redirect)
    return <div>Department not found.</div>;
  }

  return (
    <main>
      <HeroDepartmentSection departmentData={departmentData} />
      <RolesAndCultureSection departmentData={departmentData} />
      <TeamPhotosGallery departmentData={departmentData} />
      <TestimonialSection departmentData={departmentData} />
      <DepartmentPositionsSection departmentData={departmentData} />
    </main>
  );
}
✅ Development Checklist (for each component & the page)

Create src/data/departments.js with mock data for all departments.

Create src/components/header/DepartmentsDropdown.jsx and integrate into your Header.

Create component file (.jsx) inside src/components/department/ for each section.

Each department section component should be designed to accept departmentData (or specific parts of it) as props.

Add basic structure (JSX) and dynamically render content from props.

Apply Tailwind CSS classes for styling, adhering to text-cyan-600 for accents and text-[#667070] for main text.

Ensure component is fully responsive across different screen sizes.

(If applicable) Place relevant images in src/public/images (e.g., /public/images/department-hero-bg-marketing.jpg) and use next/image, dynamically selecting based on departmentData.

(If applicable) Create/use common UI elements like Button.jsx from src/components/common/.

Create the dynamic page src/app/department/[slug]/page.jsx and implement its logic to fetch and pass data.
